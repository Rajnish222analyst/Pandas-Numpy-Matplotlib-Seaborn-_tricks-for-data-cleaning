 Create a Logistic regression model as vs= weight + displacement using inbuilt dataset
mtcars. Use the splitting ratio as 80%, 20% for training and testing data. Discuss the accuracy
of the model obtained.
Solution –
#Q3
data("mtcars")
View(mtcars)
library(caTools)
# split data for testing
split <- sample.split(mtcars,SplitRatio = 0.8) # spliting data in .8 and .2 ratio
split
training <- subset(data, split == 'TRUE')
testing <- subset(data, split == 'FALSE')
md1 <- glm(mtcars$vs~mtcars$wt+mtcars$disp, data = training, family =
'binomial')
summary(md1)
plot(md1)
Inference – splitting data for training and testing (80:20)
[1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE
Call:
glm(formula = mtcars$vs ~ mtcars$wt + mtcars$disp, family = "binomial",
 data = training)

Null deviance: 43.86 on 31 degrees of freedom
Residual deviance: 21.40 on 29 degrees of freedom
AIC: 27.4
Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 6
Null deviance – when we do not include Independent variable
Residual deviance - when we include Independent variable
AIC – AIC value should increase when we remove non-significant independent
variable
